          I utilized two techniques to move the particles of the turtle:
          <span>GPGPU</span> and <span>FLOW FIELD</span>. GPGPU, or
          General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units, leverages the
          GPU for data processing rather than pixel rendering, making it ideal
          for performing complex calculations repeatedly and efficiently.
          Meanwhile, the flow field technique employs spatialized streams to
          direct the particles' movement, creating dynamic and intricate
          patterns.
